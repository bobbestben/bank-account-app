Design Bank Account App
-input and output from command line
-features: deposit, withdraw, account statement

App Structure:
Views - TBD
Controller - transactionController
Service - Deposit, Withdraw, PrintStatement
ServiceImpl - D W P
Util - validators
Constants

Todo:
-invalid options how? amount, services
-insufficient funds for withdrawl - prompt to try again
-(1)restrict user format to 2dp - think can only do validation since is cmd line, not UI
-need to output 2 decimals - if cannot do (1), need to do rounding
-create general handler for invalid input? then redirect to try again
-see which functions can put to util
-unit test, test for caps/noncaps

Variations from design requirements:
- Print Statement numbers are right aligned for easier reading
