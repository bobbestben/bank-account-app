Design Bank Account App
-input and output from command line
-features: deposit, withdraw, account statement

App Structure:
Controller (also the View layer) - transactionController
Service - transactionService
ServiceImpl - transactionServiceImpl
Util - validators, utilities
Constants

Todo:
-error handling, try catch for type error inputs
-see which functions can put to util
-unit test, test for caps/noncaps
-remove the springboot console messages before submitting

Variations from design requirements:
- Print Statement numbers are right aligned for easier reading
-- numbers are right aligned for easier reading
-- date is in dd-MMM-yyyy format to keep alignment
-- e.g. "08 Mar 2025" is printed instead of "8 Mar 2025" to keep the alignment
Date                   | Amount                | Balance
15 Mar 2025 02:32:31AM |      1,000,000,000.00 |      1,000,000,000.00
15 Mar 2025 02:32:33AM |           -100,000.00 |        999,900,000.00
15 Mar 2025 02:32:42AM |  5,000,000,000,000.00 |  5,000,999,900,000.00
- Prompters to ask user to try again if invalid amount entered for banking services
-- insufficient funds to withdraw
-- any number greater than 2 d.p.
-- any input other than D,W,P,Q at main menu
-- lowercase/uppercase d w p q handled
-- printStatement - no transactions
