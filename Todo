Design Bank Account App
-input and output from command line
-features: deposit, withdraw, account statement

App Structure:
Views - TBD
Controller - transactionController
Service - Deposit, Withdraw, PrintStatement
ServiceImpl - D W P
Util - validators
Constants

Todo:
Print
Banking services - D W P, to store and calc amt
-(1)restrict user format to 2dp - think can only do validation since is cmd line, not UI
-need to output 2 decimals - if cannot do (1), need to do rounding
-see which functions can put to util
-invalid options how? amount, services
-organize into folder


-------- Other Considerations
Close scanner?

Unit Testing
-input validation
-negative value/assumptions for negative cash
-sessions?

Security Features

Tech Stack
-DB or server storage?
-FE react?
